#### Before Linesbox: Projects feel scattered, things slip, it’s tough to see where things stand, and people are stressed. 
#### After Linesbox: Everything’s organized in one place, you’re on top of things, progress is clear, and a sense of calm sets in.

# One place, not all over the place.
Remote work is especially challenging when stuff’s spread out across emails, file services, task managers, spreadsheets, chats, meetings, etc. Things get lost, you don’t know where to look for stuff, and people put the right information in the wrong place.

But when it’s all together in Linesbox, you’ll see where everything is, understand what everyone’s working on, and know exactly where to put the next thing everyone needs to know about. Your team can access Linesbox from anywhere - on the web, on iOS, and Android. This is the modern way – The Linesbox Way to Work.
